\section{Discussion}

In this paper I set up a goal to investigate if including pretext task in training process could reduce NNs vulnerability against adversarial attacks.

\subsection{Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item high values are seen for low number of epochs, but these points correspond also to low prediction accuracy
    \item next higher value are seen when number of pretext epochs is bigger than downstream epochs
    \item jigsaw with all 24 permutation seems to make everything only worse
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item evaluation for each scenario was run only once
    \item evaluation was done only for one dataset
\end{itemize}
